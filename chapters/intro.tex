\chapter{Introduction}

It is an important task to extract some meaningful information from point clouds. By doing this we let further algorithms rely on some key extracted features instead of using points as raw factors. Our project aims on fast normal extraction method, which can significantly increase the quality and speed of underlying algorithms. Example of such algorithm is SLAM for robotics perception. Planes are the most simple objects can be extracted, though they are able to sparsely represent almost any object like wall, ground, table surface, etc.
