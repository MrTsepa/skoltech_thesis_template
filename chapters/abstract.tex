In this work new approach is proposed to solve a task of normal prediction from RGBD data. This approach consist of estimating normals on different scales using known geometrical methods and then fusing them to get final convenient normals estimation. Fusing is done by fully-convolutional neural network trained on multiview reconstructed normals captured from indoor environments. Comparing this approach and existing ones shows that it reaches nearly state-of-the-art quality while relying only on depth data not using color channels. Very efficient implementation of algorithm is also proposed, which lets it to outperform modern point cloud libraries.
