\chapter{Conclusion}

In this work we proved that idea of fusing normals estimated on different scales is working well. We believe that this idea may be improved and even state-of-the-art quality may be reached. Our current contributions are listed below.
\begin{itemize}
    \item We implemented and tested several NN architectures for multiscale normals fusion; such approach was not proposed previously.
    \item We created effective  algorithm for estimating normals on different scales simultaneously. Similar idea of using integral images was proposed before \cite{adaptive-neighborhood}, but we even improved its performance by using convolution routine.
\end{itemize}
