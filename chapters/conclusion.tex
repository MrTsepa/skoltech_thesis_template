\chapter{Conclusion}

In this work, we proved that idea of fusing normals estimated on different scales is working well. We believe that this idea may be improved, and even state-of-the-art quality may be reached. Our current contributions are listed below.
\begin{itemize}
    \item We implemented and tested several NN architectures for multiscale normals fusion; such approach was not proposed previously.
    \item We created an effective algorithm for estimating normals on different scales simultaneously. A similar idea of using integral images was proposed before \cite{adaptive-neighborhood}, but we even improved its performance by using a convolution routine.
\end{itemize}

Summing up, our \textit{Multiscale Normal Estimation} method is a production-ready approach, which also has impressive potential. Possible directions of future work may include implementing color channel fusion along with fusion of multiple scale normals and solving task of predicting normals for missing data points.
